# Munchi Documentation

## Overview
This directory contains detailed functional requirements and implementation documentation for the Munchi pet care tracking application.

## Document Structure

### Requirements Documents
Each feature has its own numbered markdown file with comprehensive requirements, implementation status, and TODO tracking.

1. **[01-authentication.md](./01-authentication.md)** - User authentication and session management
2. **[02-pet-management.md](./02-pet-management.md)** - Pet registration and information management
3. **[03-food-master.md](./03-food-master.md)** - Food catalog and nutritional data management
4. **[04-feeding-records.md](./04-feeding-records.md)** - Feeding activity tracking and records
5. **[05-dashboard.md](./05-dashboard.md)** - Main dashboard interface and quick actions
6. **[06-settings.md](./06-settings.md)** - Application settings and user preferences

## TODO Management

Each document uses markdown checkboxes to track implementation progress:
- `- [ ]` indicates a pending/incomplete task
- `- [x]` indicates a completed task

### TODO Status Legend
- **Completed**: `- [x]` Feature is fully implemented and tested
- **Pending**: `- [ ]` Feature is not yet implemented or needs work
- **In Progress**: Mentioned in current development notes

### Updating TODOs
When working on features:
1. Check the relevant document for current implementation status
2. Update checkboxes from `- [ ]` to `- [x]` when tasks are completed
3. Add new TODOs as needed during development
4. Update implementation notes with current status

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (Completed)
- [x] Authentication system

## Document Maintenance

### Adding New Features
1. Create a new numbered markdown file (e.g., `07-new-feature.md`)
2. Use the existing document structure as a template
3. Include comprehensive requirements, technical specs, and TODO items
4. Update this README to include the new document

### Updating Existing Documents
